## Technical Requirements

### Backend

- A **REST API** with the following endpoints:
  - `POST /tasks` → Create a new task.
  - `GET /tasks` → Retrieve all tasks.
  - `GET /tasks/{task_id}` → Retrieve a single task.
  - `PUT /tasks/{task_id}` → Update a task (title, description, completed status).
  - `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` → Delete a task.
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- Store each task with an **auto-incrementing ID**.

### Frontend (React + CSS)

- **State management**: Use `useState`.
- **API Calls**: Use `fetch` or `axios` to communicate with the FastAPI server.
- **Task List UI**: Display tasks with options to **edit**, **delete**, and **mark complete**.
- **Filters**: Buttons to show **All, Completed, and Pending** tasks.

## Submission Guidelines

1. To start clone this project onto your laptop.
2. Branch off of master branch creating your own feature branch, with naming convention: todo-app-yourName-yourSurname.
3. When you're done with building and testing your app, **Push the code** to **GitHub on your profile* - be sure not to push it into the master branch.
5. Include a **README.md** explaining how to run the project and any special notes you want to make us aware of.
6. **If the project cannot run on our side, unfortunately then we will not be able to evaluate it properly - so it is improtant that your app works.**
